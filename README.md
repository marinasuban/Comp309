A1 - Coverage
This assignment involves trying out a variety of classification algorithms and at least one clustering algorithm. It requires use of python, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn, so it also serves as an introduction to all those tools. 

A2 - Coverage
The goal of this assignment is to help you understand data manipulation and visualisation tools for machine learning.
The purpose is to implement common data handling methods on real-world observations. To validate the effectiveness
of the implemented methods, you are also required to perform data analysis tasks to draw useful conclusions. In
particular, the following topics should be reviewed:
• Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Data Preparation
• Feature Manipulation

A3 - Coverage
The goal of this assignment is to help you tie together all the concepts you have learnt in the first half of this course
in the lectures and assignments. To aid you in completing this assignment, you should review the major aspects of
the course that have been explored so far, such as:
• Data understanding, cleansing, and pre-processing,
• Machine learning concepts,
• CRISP-DM and pipelines in general,
• Feature manipulation, including feature selection, feature construction and imputation,
• Statistical design and analysis of results
